# RisingBubble
#### Simulation files 
bubble.c

#### Comparison with Loth (2008)
Comparison of drag coeffcient of quiescent bubble rising between our DNS and experimental fitting in Loth (2008):




#### Grid convergence 
Same simulations with different resolutions (L8/L9/L10). Results are converged between L9 and L10, therefore L9 is enough.
